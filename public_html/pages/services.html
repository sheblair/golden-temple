                    <p>Tarot is an ancient form of divination practiced for centuries throughout Europe and later in the Americas.
                        Employing a specialized deck of cards, the reader guides an individual through the mysterious labyrinth
                        of the self, allowing the subject to better understand their path, gaining clarity - from the shadowy
                        recesses of the past, through the often confusing present, to aiding the subject in understanding what
                        might yet come. While mainly used as a form of entertainment today, one can better understand ones goals,
                        motives and aspirations by use of the Tarot and one skilled at interpreting the complex symbols contained
                        in the cards.

                    <p>Sound baths are a meditative practice involving the use of resonant music particularly Crystal and Tibetan sound bowls. This creates an immersive sound that fills the room and the body, aiming to help people relax and let go of stress, anxiety, or other worries and concerns. People report feeling deeply relaxed after sound baths, which may have health benefits. During a sound bath the brainwaves go into a state of alpha relaxation, which makes you likely to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the entire night. The calming rhythm relaxes the brain, allowing you to experience a high level of sleep pressure. Generally, 1-2 sessions per month are recommended. However, if you are experiencing emotional, physical or mental challenges that need to be addressed, then weekly sessions are better. Also, if you are just starting out, then go for 4 sessions spaced 1-2 weeks apart.
