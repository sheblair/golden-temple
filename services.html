                            Generally translated as breath control, pranayama consists of techniques designed to gain 
                            mastery over the respiratory process while recognizing the connection between the breath, 
                            the mind, and the emotions. Ultimately, pranayama serves as a potent bridge between the outward, 
                            active state of doing and the internal, surrendering practice of meditation and observation. 
                            We will explore various modalities and techniques each week, Leave feeling calm and centered -

                <p>Tarot is an ancient form of divination practiced for centuries throughout Europe and later in the Americas. 
                    Employing a specialized deck of cards, the reader guides an individual through the mysterious labyrinth 
                    of the self, allowing the subject to better understand their path, gaining clarity – from the shadowy 
                    recesses of the past, through the often confusing present, to aiding the subject in understanding what 
                    might yet come. While mainly used as a form of entertainment today, one can better understand ones goals, 
                    motives and aspirations by use of the Tarot and one skilled at interpreting the complex symbols contained 
                    in the cards.
